const faqs = [
	{
		question: 'How long does it take to spin up a rack after I book?',
		answer:
			'Under normal load, a fresh fabric is powered on, image-checked, and reachable in less than five minutes. You’ll receive an email and Slack/Teams webhook when the APIC is ready.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What connection methods are supported?',
		answer:
			'Every rack exposes SSH and Telnet for CLI, WebSSH for in-browser terminals, VNC for out-of-band console, and HTTPS for the APIC GUI. No VPN is required; traffic is tunneled over TLS.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can I switch ACI versions during my session?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Each rack comes with multiple golden images (5.x and 6.x). Use the “Change Image” action in the dashboard—our automation reboots the fabric with your chosen version in ~12 min.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What happens if I run out of tokens mid-lab?',
		answer:
			'You’ll see low-balance alerts at 15 min and 5 min. If tokens reach zero, the rack pauses (state saved) for one hour, giving you time to top-up and resume without losing progress.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Is my configuration wiped after the booking?',
		answer:
			'Yes. A secure wipe script removes tenants, policies, keys, and logs. Snapshots you created manually remain available in your account for 30 days.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can multiple team members share the same rack?',
		answer:
			'Absolutely. Invite up to 5 collaborators per booking at no extra cost. Each collaborator gets their own WebSSH and VNC session with role-based access.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do tokens expire?',
		answer:
			'No. Purchased tokens sit in your wallet indefinitely. They’re only deducted when an active rack is running or when you consume premium add-ons like extended snapshot storage.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do I extend my session or cancel early?',
		answer:
			'Click “Extend” in the booking panel before your slot ends to add hours instantly (tokens apply). To cancel, hit “End Now”—unused whole-hour increments are automatically refunded.',
	},
